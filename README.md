# MemoGL, my personal game engine

**MemoGL** is a game engine built by __Marco Kouyat√©__ using OpenGL. This engine is used for the development of his current video game project called *Guide's Chapter*. The main goal of writing this game engine is to learn how game engines work.

MemoGL is supported by Windows, MacOS and Linux. Use cmake in order to build a project.

The project is still in early stage. The main steps will be 2D rendering and font rendering.
